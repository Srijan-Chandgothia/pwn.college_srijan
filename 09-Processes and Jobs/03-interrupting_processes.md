# Interrupting processes

### /challenge/run will refuse to give you the flag until you interrupt it. Good luck!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{wLFe_M-z87JIOt1oRf_nuZrYSJZ.QXzQDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember,
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wLFe_M-z87JIOt1oRf_nuZrYSJZ.QXzQDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
