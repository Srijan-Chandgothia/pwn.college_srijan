# Starting Backgrounded Processes

### Launch /challenge/run backgrounded for the flag!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{0zoNY1xAV90nOgyzESEFm2LiXSM.QX5QDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
[1] 161
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$


Yay, you started me in the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt, but you're used to that by now...

Anyways! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{0zoNY1xAV90nOgyzESEFm2LiXSM.QX5QDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}

[1]+  Done                    /challenge/run
```
