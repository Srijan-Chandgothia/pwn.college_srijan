# Command History

### This challenge will inject the flag into your history. Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{gZAlu2_QkRAyUAjxfsVxIKcFmxp.0lNzEzNxwSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{gZAlu2_QkRAyUAjxfsVxIKcFmxp.0lNzEzNxwSO4gjNzEzW}
```
