# Setting Variables

### To solve this level, you must set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE. Be careful: both the names and values of variables are case-sensitive! PWN is not the same as pwn and COLLEGE is not the same as College.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{saA5E0BalJKDHiwUlRPEWvURD_M.QX5UTN0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{saA5E0BalJKDHiwUlRPEWvURD_M.QX5UTN0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
