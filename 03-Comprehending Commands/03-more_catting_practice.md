# More Catting Practice

### In this level, I'll put the flag in some crazy directory, and I will not allow you to change directories with cd, so no cat flag for you. You must retrieve the flag by absolute path, wherever it is.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{ogkOzJ6igltsPT-vJ5WCcvLpnFH.QXwITO0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /opt/libslub/libslub/flag
pwn.college{ogkOzJ6igltsPT-vJ5WCcvLpnFH.QXwITO0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
