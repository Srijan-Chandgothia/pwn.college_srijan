# Cat: Not the Pet, but the Command!

### In this challenge, I will copy the flag to the flag file in your home directory (where your shell starts). Go read it with cat!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{McvluCGv1VRRWhFMSYe1i8FyLJw.QXxcTN0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{McvluCGv1VRRWhFMSYe1i8FyLJw.QXxcTN0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
