# Your First Shell Script

### Same as last level, run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, but this time in a shell script called x.sh, then run it with bash!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{ISDrk9R5G31VQ3kKRjaAXiO3Rep.QXxcDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ touch x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ echo "/challenge/pwn;/challenge/college" > x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash x.sh
Great job, you've written your first shell script! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{ISDrk9R5G31VQ3kKRjaAXiO3Rep.QXxcDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
