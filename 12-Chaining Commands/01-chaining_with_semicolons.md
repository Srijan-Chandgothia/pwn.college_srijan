# Chaining with Semicolons

### In this level, you must run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, chaining them with a semicolon.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{YKUFFhKovSIpURmLLZg-yfPqek4.QX1UDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn;/challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YKUFFhKovSIpURmLLZg-yfPqek4.QX1UDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
