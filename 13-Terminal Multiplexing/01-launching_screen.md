# Launching Screen

### For this challenge, we've hooked things up so that just launching screen will get you the flag. Easy!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

```
#!/bin/bash

Congratulations! You're inside a screen session!
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{YObV-2WK4K0HT2X3OiFGmsX1x2v.0VN4IDOxwSO4gjNzEzW}
```
