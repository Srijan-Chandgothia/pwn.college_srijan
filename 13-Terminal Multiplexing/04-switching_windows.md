# Switching Windows

### For this challenge, we've set up a screen session with two windows:

Window 0 has... well, you'll have to switch there to find out!
Window 1 has a welcome message.
Attach to the session with screen -r, then use one of the key combinations above to switch to Window 1. Go get that flag!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{kN9zuI46s6bGC5wUUOivkwIM909.0FO4IDOxwSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@terminal-multiplexing~switching-windows:~$  cat <<MSG
> Excellent work! You found window 0!
> Here is your flag: pwn.college{kN9zuI46s6bGC5wUUOivkwIM909.0FO4IDOxwSO4gjNzEzW}
