# Detaching and Attaching

### For this challenge, you'll need to:

Launch screen
Detach from it.
Run /challenge/run (this will secretly send the flag to your detached session!)
Reattach to see your prize

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8Wg2vEeDe3MXOZf-Z6zM6mDGrG-.0lN4IDOxwSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@terminal-multiplexing~detaching-and-attaching:~$ echo Yes! Flag is: pwn.college{8Wg2vEeDe3MXOZf-Z6zM6mDGrG-.0lN4IDOxwSO4gjNzEzW}
