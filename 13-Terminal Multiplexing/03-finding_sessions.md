# Finding Sessions

### In this challenge, we've created three screen sessions for you. One of them contains the flag. The other two are decoys!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{At9a2ycU6uhMAwm4rqYFiDHRfmf.01N4IDOxwSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@terminal-multiplexing~finding-sessions:~$  echo 'Congratulations! You found the right session!'
Congratulations! You found the right session!
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~finding-sessions:~$  echo pwn.college{At9a2ycU6uhMAwm4rqYFiDHRfmf.01N4IDOxwSO4gjNzEzW}
pwn.college{At9a2ycU6uhMAwm4rqYFiDHRfmf.01N4IDOxwSO4gjNzEzW}
```
