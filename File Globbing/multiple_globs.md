# Multiple Globs

### We put a few happy, but diversely-named files in /challenge/files. Go cd there and run /challenge/run, providing a single argument: a short (3 characters or less) globbed word with two * globs in it that covers every word that contains the letter p.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{0Thc3Q1pnwNe-DRXN0uwgbq70Ub.0lM3kjNxwSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{0Thc3Q1pnwNe-DRXN0uwgbq70Ub.0lM3kjNxwSO4gjNzEzW}
```
