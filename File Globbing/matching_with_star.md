# Matching With *

### Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use globbing to keep the argument you pass to cd to at most four characters! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{IsMBsumm4VvhU6N8JWHP3Ipgjea.QXxIDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IsMBsumm4VvhU6N8JWHP3Ipgjea.QXxIDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
