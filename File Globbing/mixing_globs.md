# Mixing Globs

### We put a few happy, but diversely-named files in /challenge/files. Go cd there and, using the globbing you've learned, write a single, short (6 characters or less) glob that (when passed as an argument to /challenge/run) will match the files "challenging", "educational", and "pwning"!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ulc28-T37i8UCo_BBcMDalAUz8B.QX1IDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Ulc28-T37i8UCo_BBcMDalAUz8B.QX1IDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}
