# Position Yet Elsewhere

### This challenge will require you to execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path (which it will tell you). You'll need to cd to that directory before rerunning the challenge program. Good luck!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{krCAFjJ_ZGKoYfhFMt5Pivpvzbo.QX4QTN0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the / directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{krCAFjJ_ZGKoYfhFMt5Pivpvzbo.QX4QTN0wSO4gjNzEzW}
