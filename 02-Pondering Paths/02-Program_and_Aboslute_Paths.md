# Program and Absolute Paths

### This challenge again requires you to execute it by invoking its absolute path. You'll want to execute the run file that is in the challenge directory that is, in turn, in the / directory. If you invoke the challenge correctly, it will give you the flag. Good luck!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8-TZ6nmXBa7-C9c_aQZPpUa8GB2.QX1QTN0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8-TZ6nmXBa7-C9c_aQZPpUa8GB2.QX1QTN0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
