# Intro to Commands

### In this level, invoke the hello command to get the flag! Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: hello is different from HELLO.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{suFmFkZWSBbDV1FL1wrnN4836f_.QX3YjM1wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{suFmFkZWSBbDV1FL1wrnN4836f_.QX3YjM1wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
