# Multi_word Variables

### In this level, you'll need to set the variable PWN to COLLEGE YEAH. Good luck!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{gYgk5AeYyRE4SRDUGsfYlJshf1J.QXwYTN0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{gYgk5AeYyRE4SRDUGsfYlJshf1J.QXwYTN0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
