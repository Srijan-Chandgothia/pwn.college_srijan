# Reading Files

### Read /challenge/read_me into the PWN environment variable, and we'll give you the flag! The /challenge/read_me will keep changing, so you'll need to read it right into the PWN variable with one command!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{M92OFyPKZJJhuYgl-2LrpHQXRb6.QXwIDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{M92OFyPKZJJhuYgl-2LrpHQXRb6.QXwIDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
