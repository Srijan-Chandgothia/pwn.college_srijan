# Tab Completion

### This challenge has copied the flag into /challenge/pwncollege, and you can freely cat that file. But you can't type the filename: we used some serious trickery to make sure that you must tab-complete it. 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{MC31YQpeKTkw-yE56XgNYSE6WvZ.0FN0EzNxwSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollege
cat: /challenge/pwncollege: No such file or directory
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹
pwn.college{MC31YQpeKTkw-yE56XgNYSE6WvZ.0FN0EzNxwSO4gjNzEzW}
```
