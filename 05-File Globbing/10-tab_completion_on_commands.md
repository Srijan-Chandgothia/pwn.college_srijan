# Tab Completion on Commands

### Tab completion is for more than files! You can also tab-complete commands. This level has a command that starts with pwncollege, and it'll give you the flag. Type pwncollege and hit the tab key to auto-complete it!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{4z2IAGlVYRYZywF9TFDHULqQuOs.0VN0EzNxwSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-2155
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4z2IAGlVYRYZywF9TFDHULqQuOs.0VN0EzNxwSO4gjNzEzW}
```
