# Learning from Documentation

### The program for this challenge is /challenge/challenge, and you'll need to invoke it properly in order for it to give you the flag. Let's pretend that this is its documentation:

Welcome to the documentation for /challenge/challenge! To properly run this program, you will need to pass it the argument of --giveflag. Good luck!

Given that knowledge, go get the flag!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8GQbOkHI-EpsXrUIhGe2rn7-wWs.QX0ITO0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8GQbOkHI-EpsXrUIhGe2rn7-wWs.QX0ITO0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
