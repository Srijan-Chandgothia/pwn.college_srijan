# Mkaing Directories

### Now, go forth and create a /tmp/pwn directory and make a college file in it! Then run /challenge/run, which will check your solution and give you the flag!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{0xmBPSlRnRNIdj8cwueOe6xA4KW.QXxMDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ mkdir /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ cd /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ touch college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ cd
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0xmBPSlRnRNIdj8cwueOe6xA4KW.QXxMDO0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
