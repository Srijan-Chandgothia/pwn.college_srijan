# Catting Absolute Paths

### In this directory, I will not copy it to your home directory, but I will make it readable. You can read it with cat at its absolute path: /flag.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{UMb91YPKSeMK3X1fiwH_65Gus5P.QX5ETO0wSO4gjNzEzW}`

```
#!/bin/bash

hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{UMb91YPKSeMK3X1fiwH_65Gus5P.QX5ETO0wSO4gjNzEzW}
```
